kindle-vocabulary
=================

Extract looked up words from Amazon's Kindle Vocabulary Builder, and look them up in a StarDict dictionary.

The code uses a modified version of the very useful Python library for reading
StarDict files, which can be found at
https://github.com/pysuxing/python-stardict.  The changes, as the whole script,
are under GPL3 license, as is the original library.
